This section is intended to introduce to course and topics. 
The material is largely based on the preface and introduction to the textbook: "In all Likelihood", by Yudi Pawitan, which is listed as one of the supplemental texts for this course.

While the approach of not continuing exactly from where we left off is a bit unconventional, I first wanted to ground this semester's material in the context of Statistics as a discipline, and providing room for us to discuss additional topics outside of the John Rice textbook, as this is likely the last statistics course many of the students in the course will take.
