### Planned topics (Spring 2026)

The course description and objectives provide very little direction for this course.
A tentative list of course topics is provided below.
In parenthesis is provided some supplementary reference chapters from relevant textbooks.

- Parameter estimation
   - Method of moments estimators (Rice, 8.4)
   - Maximum likelihood estimation (Rice, 8.5)
   - Bayesian estimation (Rice, 8.6)
   - Sufficiency, minimal sufficiency, and the invariance principle (Rice 8.8, Pawitan 3.1--3.2, Pawitan 2.8--2.9)
- Parameter uncertainty
   - Exact Intervals (e.g., Rice 8.5.3)
   - Revisiting Bayesian posteriors (Rice, 8.6)
   - Frequentist intervals 
      - The Score function and Fisher's Information / Observed Information (Pawitan 2.5)

- Hypothesis testing (Rice 9.1--9.5, Casella and Berger 8.3)
    - Neyman-Pearson vs Fisher
    - Uniformly most powerful tests
    - Duality of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.
